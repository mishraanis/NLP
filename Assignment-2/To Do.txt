1) Plots File for Dataset 1
2) Accuracy and Macro-F1 file for Dataset 1
3) Check M4 > M123 for Dataset 1
4) Check whether best M4 test is >0.6 for Dataset 1 

Create a folder for deliverables in the submission zip apart from task 1, task 2 folders. This folder should contains copies of everything stated in deliverables in one place with proper naming convention
Report complete

Evaluate and explain the plots for Dataset 1 and 2

Calculate the label-wise F1 scores (for 13 labels) on test data of Dataset_1 using the
best-performing model. Plot a bar graph or pie chart for this using code. - Optional

Create separate .ipynb files for each part. The file name should follow the format:
“A2_<Part number>.ipynb”

Create a single .ipynb file for generating the final outputs that are required for submittables. It
should be named as “A2_<Group No>_infer.ipynb”. Clearly indicate which cell corresponds to
the output of which task/subtask.
